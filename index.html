                <h1>The Story:</h1>
                <p>Water pollution has been becoming a major issue in the United States and around the world in the recent years.<br>
                   Water would be classified as being "polluted" when it does not support human use anymore or it undergoes a shift in its inbility to support biotic communitites.<br>
                   Water pollution affects the entire biosphere, plants, and organisms living in these bodies of water. In almost all cases the effect is damaging not only to individual species and population, but also to the natural biological communities.<br>
                   It is estimated 580 people in India die of water pollution related illness every day and about 90 percent of the water in the cities of China is polluted.<br>
                   in the most recent national report on water quality in the United States, 45 percent of assessed stream miles, 47% of assessed lake acres, and 32 percent of assessed bays and estuarine square miles were classified as polluted.<br>
                   Pollution from factories releases heavy metals like aluminum and nercury into the water which also causes water pollution.<br>
